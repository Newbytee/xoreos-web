This past Saturday, I was being [interviewed for the Neverwinter Nights Podcast about the xoreos project](http://www.nwnpodcast.com/nwnp/2014/04/22/nwnp-podcast-episode-192-xoreos-an-open-source-reimplementation-of-the-bioware-aurora-engine/). I talked a bit how this project got started, what I'm focusing on and about the current situation.

Not being used to being interviewed, or speaking English for that matter, my nervousness is quite audible. But I hope I still got my points across. :)

So, if you're interested, [give it a listen](http://www.nwnpodcast.com/nwnp/2014/04/22/nwnp-podcast-episode-192-xoreos-an-open-source-reimplementation-of-the-bioware-aurora-engine/).
