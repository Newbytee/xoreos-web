Thanks to [Alex Bevilacqua](https://github.com/alexbevi), xoreos now has a new website, based on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and a new logo, based on the [Rezland font](http://www.dafont.com/rezland.font). This certainly looks far better than my crude design attempts. :)

We are still desperately looking for new developers, though. If you havenâ€™t already, please read the [relevant blog post](/blog/2013/06/07/xoreos-needs-your-help/).
