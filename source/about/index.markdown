## <a id="whatis"></a>What is xoreos?

xoreos is an ongoing FLOSS project to reimplement [BioWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare's [Aurora engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare#Aurora_Engine) (and derivatives) as used in their 3D games, beginning with [Neverwinter Nights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights). The goal is to have a portable program to play those games even on operating systems those games were never meant to be played on, such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.

## <a id="license"></a>How is it licensed?

xoreos is free software and licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://github.com/DrMcCoy/xoreos/blob/master/COPYING) or later (GPLv3+).

## <a id="piracy"></a>A note about piracy

To use xoreos to run the games, you have own the original game media. We do not endorse piracy in any way, shape or form.

## <a id="currentstatus"></a>What does currently work?

In its current state, xoreos is still far away from its goal. At the moment, we are able to load resource archives and read basic file formats. Video and sound playing works, models are partially supported, and for earlier games, areas are shown and even some very basic gameplay exists.

## <a id="workleft"></a>What is left to do?

A lot of work is still left to do. We are actively looking for developers interested in joining our efforts in taking apart BioWare games and reimplementing them. If that sounds something you would find exciting and feel capable of, please contact us. We are always happy to see new faces. :)

The most pressing matter, however, is finding a person with knowledge of OpenGL: The current graphics subsystem is barebones and was quickly hacked together without much deeper understanding. If works for what is shown right now, but is far from being anywhere near adequate. There are a lot of features missing, and the performance is nothing to be proud of. Again, we would be very glad to welcome you in our still small team!

## <a id="detailedinfo"></a>Need more detailed information?

You can find the project here on github and here is a repository containing assorted tools. The project wiki has further information: a more detailed description of the current status, more screenshots and a long TODO list. If you'd like to see some moving pictures, this youtube playlist has some (slightly outdated) videos to showcase the project. And if you'd like to contact us for any reason, please do so using the project mailing list
