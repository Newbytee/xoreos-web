## <a id="whatis"></a>What is xoreos?

xoreos is an ongoing FLOSS project to reimplement [BioWare's Aurora engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare#Aurora_Engine) (and derivatives) as used in their 3D games, beginning with [Neverwinter Nights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights). The goal is to have a portable program to play those games even on operating systems those games were never meant to be played on, such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.

## <a id="license"></a>How is it licensed?

xoreos is free software and licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://github.com/xoreos/xoreos/blob/master/COPYING) or later (GPLv3+).

## <a id="piracy"></a>A note about piracy

To use xoreos to run the games, you have own the original game media. We do not endorse piracy in any way, shape or form.

## <a id="currentstatus"></a>What does currently work?

Currently, the "foundation" work of managing resources, reading many basic file formats, displaying graphics and playing sounds has been done. All targeted games show partial ingame graphics, such as the area geometry and objects, letting you fly around in a "spectator mode". Some games show partial menus, and something resembling a starting point for a script system is there.

No actual "normal" gameplay is implemented yet, though.

## <a id="workleft"></a>What is left to do?

A lot of work is still left to do. We are actively looking for developers interested in joining our efforts in taking apart BioWare games and reimplementing them. If that sounds something you would find exciting and feel capable of, please [contact us](https://wiki.xoreos.org/index.php?title=Contact_us). We are always happy to see new faces. :)
